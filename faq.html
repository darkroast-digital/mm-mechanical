			<div class="faq__question">
				<h6>Why should I replace my existing heating or air conditioning system?</h6>
				<p>You ay wish to consider replacing your air conditioning or heating system if it is old, inefficient or in need of repair. Today's systems are as much as 60% more efficient than those systems manufactured as little as ten years ago. In addition, if not properly maintained, wear and tear on a system can reduce the actual or realized efficiency of the system. If you are concerned about utility bills or are faced with an expensive repair, you may want to consider replacing your system rather than enduring another costly season or paying to replace an expensive compnenet. The utility cost savings of a new unity may provide an attractive return on your investment. If you plan on financing the purchase, the monthly savings on your utility bill should be considred when determining the actual monthly cost of replacing a system.</p>

			<div class="faq__question">
				<h6>The offsetting savings may permit you to purchase a more efficient system.  What is involved in replacing an old system?</h6>
				<p>Aside from the placement of the new equipment. MM Mechanical will inspect several items and make a determination of whether or not these items need to be supplied or replaced. Some of the items include: duct work, insulation, refrigerant piping, electrical service, wiring, thermostat, condensate piping, flue piping, flue terminations, chimney liner, slabs, filter, driers, registers, grills, grain pans, and evaporator coil.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="faq__question">
				<h6>What is involved in installing a new system?</h6>
				<p>If a system is being added to the home for the first time, most of the items notd in the previous question and answer may be required to install the new system. Besides the equipment, the most significant component is duct work. The duct work can be either mental or fibreglass duct work. The duct work needs to be properly sized to deliver the right amount or air handler and delivers air to individual zones in your home.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="faq__question">
				<h6>How long can I expect a new system to last?</h6>
				<p>If you have a qualified technician perform regular preventative maintenance and service suggested for your unit, industry averages suggest that an air conditioner should last 12-15 years (sea coast applications may be less) and a gas furnace should last as many as 20-25 years.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- End FAQ Question -->

			<div class="faq__question">
				<h6>What size of a heating, ventilation and/ or air conditioning unit do I need?</h6>
				<p>It may be caused by an improperly-sized furnace or air conditioner or your duct system is not designed for the optimal air flow to every room in the house. MM Mechanical can trouble-shoot the problem and determine if your furnace and/ or air conditioner is sufficient, as well as review the existing duct work for optimal air flow.</p>

			<div class="faq__question">
				<h6>What is SEER?</h6>
				<p>SEER is an abbreviation for season energy efficiecy rating and is a measure of how efficient a unit operates. A 13 SEER product for example would be more efficient than a 10 SEER unit.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- End FAQ Question -->

			<div class="faq__question">
				<h6>Can I place around my outdoor unit?</h6>
				<p>Yes, but make sure you keep clearance for proper airflow. WILL YOU REMOVE MY OLD EQUIPMENT AND DISPOSE OF IT? Yes, we remove all old equipment and recover any refrigerant.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- End FAQ Question -->

			<div class="faq__question">
				<h6>How much will a 13 SEER A/C save me over my current system?</h6>
				<p>Typically most of the older units we replace have ratings of 8-10 SEER, so you could expect savings in the 40-40% range on your cooling bill.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- End FAQ Question -->

			<div class="faq__question">
				<h6>My air conditioner/ furnace has a white frost or ice on the copper lines. What should I do?</h6>
				<p>Shut off the system and turn the fan to the 'on' position to thaw the lines. Call MM Mechanical, there is a problem with the unit that should be addressed immidatley.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- End FAQ Question -->

			<div class="faq__question">
				<h6>Is there any advantage to setting my thermostat fan to 'on' so the fan runs constantly?</h6>
				<p>There are a couple. One is that you get constant filtering of the air in your home. The other is that because the air is moving, you have a more even temperature throughout the home.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- End FAQ Question -->

			<div class="faq__question">
				<h6>Should I cover my outdoor unit in the winter?</h6>
				<p>Covering your unity is not necessary. Air conditioners are manufactured to withstand all possible climate changes. In fact, rain helps keep your unit clean. Heat pumps run all year long, so it is important that they should never be covered.</p>
